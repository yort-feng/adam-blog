I'm new to Blog, this article is kind of the first blog in my life, since I'm a fanatic of learning english, I'd like to talk about one of the biggest areas of confusion for learning english is the difference between the past tense and the present perfect.

* V(d): past tense is indicated by use of past tense market, represented here by V sub d

  > Here are some examples of regular verbs and their past tense forms

    |V|V(d)|
    |---|---|
    |walk|walked|
    |wait|waited|
    |arrive|arrived|
    |open|opened|
    |close|closed|
    
  > However, some of the most common verbs in english are irregular, so it is important to learn them, altogether, there are over 200 irregular verbs in normal use
  
    |V|V(d)|
    |---|---|
    |eat|ate|
    |wake|woke|
    |see|saw|
    |know|knew|
    |be|was/were|
